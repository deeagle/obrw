# OBRW

**OBRW** means *OpenBoxRandomWallpaper*.

## Desc

**OBRW** is a tool to set wallpapers randomly for the window manager **openbox**.
It's started as my '_first C-language-project_' and helped me to pass my exams.

But why **C** and not another bash-script or maybe python?  
Because **openbox** is in **C**.

ATM it's not really perfect and I'm not a C-programmer, but the tool is working for years in my environments.

## Externals

**OBRW** depends on:
- **feh** a fast and light lmlib2-based image viewer 

## Weblinks
A good choice to start with openbox is the project page or the debian-wiki.
