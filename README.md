# OBRW - OpenBoxRandomWallpaper

![Build status](https://github.com/deeagle/obrw/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

**OBRW** is a tool to set wallpapers randomly for the window manager **openbox**.
It's started as my '_first C-language-project_' and helped me to pass my exams.

> But why **C** and not another bash-script or maybe python?

Because **openbox** is in **C**.

ATM it's not really perfect, and I'm still not a C-programmer,
but the tool is working for years in my environments and I have some fun.

My most used commands are implemented via `make`.

## Externals

**OBRW** depends on:

- **feh** a fast and light `lmlib2`-based image viewer

## Weblinks

  - [Openbox project](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page)
  - [wiki.debian.org](https://wiki.debian.org/Openbox)
  - [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/)
