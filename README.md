**OBRW** is a tool to set wallpapers randomly for the window manager **openbox**.
It's started as my '_first C-language-project_' and helped me to pass my uni-exams.
Why **C** and not another bash-script? Because **openbox** is in **C**.

ATM it's not really perfect and I'm not a C-programmer, but the tool is working for four years in my environments.
